# Getting started

Before starting the process, we must check if you have CFW.

## CFW Check

1. Hold `select` and boot the system.
2. If the 3DS boots normally, you are good.

!> If you come across a strange screen, hold on for a moment! It looks like you already have Custom Firmware installed. In that case, it's recommended to follow [this guide](placeholder) instead.

## System Firmware Check

1. Access the `System Settings` application from the main menu.
2. Locate your system version in the lower right corner of the screen.

## Find your method

If your system version is `11.16.0-49U`, kindly continue following the provided guide.

However, if your system version is different, such as `11.17.0-50U` or any variant with a different letter at the end, please make use of SuperSkaterhax (placeholder until made).
